# Meditation App Release 1.4.0

**Release Date**: May 15, 2025

## Summary

Release 1.4.0 introduces a new approach to API key management, allowing users to add and manage their OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys directly through the application's user interface. This release also centralizes environment configuration by moving from a backend-specific `.env` file to a single project-level configuration file, simplifying the setup process for all users.

## New Features

### Centralized Environment Configuration
- Single `.env` file at the project root for all configuration
- Simplified setup for both development and production environments
- Unified configuration management for both frontend and backend services

### API Key Management UI
- New dedicated section in the Settings page for API key management
- Secure input fields for entering OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys
- Visual indicators showing which voice services are currently available
- Ability to update or delete existing API keys
- Real-time validation of API keys before saving

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend Changes

#### Environment Configuration Updates
- Update dotenv configuration to look for `.env` file at project root
- Create migration script to move existing backend `.env` settings to root file
- Update Docker configurations to use the centralized `.env` file
- Document new environment setup in README and deployment guides

#### API Key Management API
- Create secure API endpoints for storing and retrieving API keys
- Implement API key validation endpoints that test keys against provider services
- Add key encryption for secure storage in configuration files
- Create API key status endpoint to report availability of voice services

### Frontend Changes

#### Settings Page Updates
- Design and implement API key management interface
- Create secure input fields for API keys with appropriate masking
- Add validation feedback for entered API keys
- Implement "Test Connection" functionality for each service
- Create user-friendly guided workflow for first-time key setup

#### Voice Configuration Updates
- Update voice selection UI to indicate which services require API keys
- Add tooltips and help text explaining how to enable voice services

#### User Experience Improvements
- Add loading indicators during API key validation
- Create success/failure notifications for key operations
- Implement secure handling of API keys in frontend state management
- Add contextual help for obtaining API keys from service providers

## Data Structure

The API key management system will use the following data structures:

```json
// API Key Configuration (stored encrypted)
{
  "openai": {
    "key": "encrypted-key-value",
    "validated": true,
    "lastValidated": "2025-05-10T15:30:00Z"
  },
  "elevenlabs": {
    "key": "encrypted-key-value",
    "validated": false,
    "lastValidated": "2025-05-09T12:45:00Z"
  }
}

// API Key Status Response
{
  "services": {
    "openai": {
      "available": true,
      "lastChecked": "2025-05-10T15:30:00Z",
      "features": ["tts"]
    },
    "elevenlabs": {
      "available": false,
      "lastChecked": "2025-05-10T15:30:00Z",
      "features": ["tts"],
      "error": "API key validation failed"
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Centralized Configuration
1. Create root `.env` file structure
2. Update backend to read from root `.env`
3. Create migration tool for existing setups
4. Update documentation and guides

### Phase 2: API Key Management Backend
1. Implement secure API key storage system
2. Create API endpoints for key management
3. Develop validation service for keys
4. Implement feature availability detection

### Phase 3: API Key Management Frontend
1. Design settings interface components
2. Implement API key input forms and validation
3. Create API key management workflow
4. Add service status indicators

## Testing Plan

1. **Configuration Testing**
   - Verify application correctly reads from root `.env` file
   - Test configuration with missing API keys
   - Validate Docker deployment with new configuration

2. **API Key Management Testing**
   - Test API key validation against actual services
   - Verify secure storage of API keys
   - Test key update and deletion flows
   - Validate error handling for invalid keys

3. **User Experience Testing**
   - Test user interface for API key management
   - Verify appropriate UI indications for service status
   - Validate voice configuration workflows

4. **Security Testing**
   - Audit API key handling in frontend and backend
   - Test protection against common security vulnerabilities
   - Verify API key encryption at rest

## Rollback Plan

1. **Quick Rollback**
   - Maintain compatibility with backend `.env` file
   - Create script to restore previous configuration
   - Implement feature flags to disable new API key UI if needed

2. **Monitoring**
   - Track API key validation success rates
   - Monitor voice service availability
   - Track user engagement with API key setup process

## Success Metrics

- 95% success rate for API key validation attempts
- 50% increase in users configuring voice guidance
- Reduced support inquiries about API key setup
- Zero security incidents related to API key handling
