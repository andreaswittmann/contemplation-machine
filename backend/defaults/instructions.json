    "content": "1. Sit upright in a relaxed posture, allowing your body to feel stable yet at ease.\n2. Keep your gaze gently lowered or close your eyes if that feels more comfortable.\n3. Rest your attention lightly on the space of your mind, noticing the arising of thoughts or emotions.\n4. Without suppressing or clinging to any mental event, let each thought or feeling pass through awareness naturally.\n5. Explore the clear, open quality of your mind, remaining present with whatever arises moment by moment.\n6. When you feel distracted, simply acknowledge it, then release and return to your open awareness.\n7. Maintain a relaxed vigilance, neither too tight nor too loose, allowing the mind to settle on its own.\n8. Conclude by gently reorienting yourself, opening your eyes, and taking a few mindful breaths.",
