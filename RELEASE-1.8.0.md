## Technical Considerations

### Backward Compatibility

- Ensure upgrades from previous versions preserve user data
- Maintain compatibility with existing preset files and meditation instructions
- Add migration scripts where necessary

### Performance Impact

- Audit application for performance impacts from rebranding changes
- Optimize image assets to keep the application lightweight
- Ensure documentation consolidation doesn't impact application load times

### Testing Requirements

- Test on all supported platforms to ensure consistent branding
- Verify all documentation links work properly
- Ensure Docker configurations reflect the new branding
