# Issues to address
- "Update Preset" must not work on System Presets
- ElevenLabs "Save Key" should update the Voice List.
- Configuaration Page should have an alternative "Begin Session" button.
- The Duration Slider on the Confiuration Page is hard to handle. I need a more precise Input Method.
- If on line of a instruction get's updated the cache is data/audio-cache does not invalidate the correspondint sound file.
