## Issues to Address for Next Release

### 1. System Preset Protection
**Issue:** "Update Preset" functionality currently works on System Presets, which should be protected from modification.  
**Proposed Solution:** Add a preset type flag to distinguish between user-created and system presets. Disable the "Update" button for system presets in the UI and add server-side validation to reject modification requests for system presets.  
**Implementation:**  
- Add `isSystemPreset` boolean flag to preset data model
- Update frontend to conditionally render or disable the "Update" button based on this flag
- Add validation logic in the backend API endpoint that handles preset updates

### 2. ElevenLabs Integration Enhancement  
**Issue:** The "Save Key" functionality for ElevenLabs doesn't currently trigger a refresh of the available Voice List.  
**Proposed Solution:** Implement automatic Voice List refresh after API key validation and saving.  
**Implementation:**  
- Modify the key saving logic to immediately fetch the updated voice list after successful key validation
- Add a loading state during the voice list refresh process
- Implement error handling for cases where voice list fetching fails

### 3. Configuration Page Navigation Improvement  
**Issue:** The Configuration Page lacks an alternative "Begin Session" button, requiring users to navigate elsewhere to start meditation.  
**Proposed Solution:** Add a prominent "Begin Session" button to the Configuration Page that allows users to immediately start a meditation session with current settings.  
**Implementation:**  
- Add the button in a visually accessible location on the Configuration Page
- Ensure the button triggers the same session start flow as the existing method
- Update UI styling to maintain visual hierarchy and design consistency

### 4. Duration Input Precision  
**Issue:** The Duration Slider on the Configuration Page is difficult to manipulate precisely.  
**Proposed Solution:** Add a numeric input field alongside the slider to allow for exact time specification.  
**Implementation:**  
- Add a number input field that displays the current duration in minutes/seconds
- Implement two-way binding between the slider and numeric input
- Add validation to ensure values stay within allowed minimum/maximum bounds
- Consider adding preset duration buttons (5, 10, 15, 20 min) for quick selection

### 5. Audio Cache Invalidation  
**Issue:** Audio cache does not properly invalidate when a single line of an instruction is updated.  
**Proposed Solution:** Implement a more robust cache invalidation mechanism based on content hashing rather than just filename.  
**Implementation:**  
- Modify the caching mechanism to create hashes based on the full instruction content
- Ensure instruction text changes trigger regeneration of the corresponding audio files
- Add logging for cache invalidation events to aid in troubleshooting
- Consider adding a manual "Regenerate Audio" option for administrators
