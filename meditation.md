**Title:** 
MAHAMUDRA ASPIRATION by Karmapa Rangjung Dorje

**Description:**
NAMO GURU

**Instructions:**
1. Gurus, yidams, and deities of the mandala, Victorious ones of the three times and ten directions, together with your descendants, Please consider us with compassion and grant your blessings So that our aspirations may be accomplished just as we intend.
2. May the river of the accumulated virtue of threefold purity, Springing from the snow mountain of the pure thoughts and deeds Of ourselves and limitless sentient beings Flow into the ocean of the four kayas of the victorious ones.
3. Until this is accomplished, Through all our lives, birth after birth, May we not even hear the words "evil deeds" and "suffering," And enjoy the glorious ocean of happiness and virtue.
4. Being free and well-favored, endowed with faith, exertion, and pranja, Relying on an excellent spiritual friend, and receiving the pith instructions, May we encounter no obstacles to practicing them correctly, And may we practice the holy dharma through all our lives.
5. Studying scriptures and reasoning frees from the obscuration of ignorance. Contemplating the oral instructions conquers the darkness of doubt. The light born of meditation illuminates the natural state, just as it is. May the brilliance of the three pranjas increase.
6. Through the ground of the two truths, free from the extremes of eternalism and nihilism, And through the supreme path of the two accumulations, free from the extremes of exaggeration and denial, May we attain the fruition of the two benefits, free from the extremes of samsara and nirvana, And so meet with the unerring dharma.
7. The basis of purification is mind itself, the unity of luminosity and emptiness. The means of purification is the great vajra yoga of mahamudra What is to be purified is the temporary stains of confusion. May we manifest the result of purification, the stainless dharmakaya.
8. Cutting doubts about the ground is confidence in the view. Sustaining that without wandering is the key point of meditation. Training in all aspects of meditation is supreme action. May we have confidence in the view, meditation, and action.
9. All phenomena are the illusory display of mind. There is no mind; mind is empty of an essence. Empty and unceasing, it appears as anything whatsoever. Investigating this thoroughly, may we ascertain the ground.
10. Our nonexistent projections are mistaken to be objects. Through ignorance, intrinsic awareness is mistaken to be a self. Through clinging to this duality, we wander within samsara. May we cut the root of ignorance and confusion.
11. It is not existent, as even the victorious ones have not seen it. It is not nonexistent, as it is the basis of all, samsara and nirvana. This is not a contradiction, as it is the middle way of unity. May we realize the dharmata of mind, free from extremes.
12. It cannot be shown by saying, "This is it." It cannot be refuted by saying, "This is not it." It is unconditioned dharmata, beyond conceptual mind. May we know with certainty the perfect ultimate truth.
13. Whoever does not realize this circles in the ocean of samsara; Whoever realizes this is no other than a buddha. Everything is altogether free from "it is this" or "it is not this." May we know the secret nature of dharmata, the ground of all.
14. Appearance is mind; emptiness is also mind. Realization is mind; confusion is also mind. Birth is mind; cessation is also mind. May we cut through all doubts about mind.
15. Unspoiled by deliberate, conceptual meditation, Unmoved by the wind of ordinary busyness, May we skillfully sustain the essential practice of mind That knows how to rest naturally in the uncontrived, innate state.
16. The waves of coarse and subtle thoughts subsiding by themselves, May the water of unmoving mind rest naturally. Free from the disturbances of drowsiness and dullness, May the ocean of shamatha be stable and unmoving.
17. Looking again and again at the mind that cannot be looked at, What cannot be seen is seen clearly, just as it is. Cutting doubts about what it is or is not, Free from confusion, may our true nature recognize itself.
18. Looking at objects, there are no objects; we see only mind. Looking at mind, there is no mind; it is empty of an essence. Looking at both, dualistic clinging is spontaneously liberated. May we realize luminosity, the true nature of mind.
19. Free from mental fabrications, it is mahamudra Free from extremes, it is the great madhyamaka. Containing everything, it is also known as the great completion. May we gain confidence that, by knowing just this, we realize the meaning of all.
20. Great bliss, free from attachment, is unceasing. Luminosity, free from clinging to concepts, is unobscured. Nonthought, beyond intellect, is spontaneously present. May these experiences, free from effort, be unceasing.
21. Clinging to good experiences is spontaneously liberated. The confusion of negative thoughts is naturally purified in space. Ordinary mind, free from accepting and rejecting, loss and gain. May we realize the truth of dharmat, simplicity.
22. Though the nature of beings is always enlightened, Not realizing this, they wander endlessly in samsara. May overwhelming compassion be born in us For sentient beings whose suffering is boundless.
23. In the moment of love, when overwhelming compassion flows freely, Its empty nature nakedly appears. May we meditate day and night Inseparable from this unity, the supreme unerring path.
24. Through the dharma eyes and higher perceptions born of meditation, May we ripen sentient beings, establish buddha fields, And fulfill our aspiration to attain the qualities of a buddha. Having perfected ripening, establishing, and fulfilling, may we attain buddhahood.
25. By the power of the compassion of the victorious ones of the ten directions and their descendants And by the power of all the pure virtue there is, May our pure aspirations and those of all sentient beings Be accomplished just as we intend.

 ## MettaâLoving Kindness
 
 
 
Relaxing a Small Child - We train the mind as if we were bringing up a very small child.  In the earliest phases utterly gentle.  As you settle your body in its natural state, first of all with the sole emphasis just on relaxation, utterly gentle and loose.  Then as with a very young child you introduce a mild degree of discipline, the stillness of the body and   then finally you introduce the element of vigilance.  This fine balance, the gentleness persists but balance with the stillness and the vigilance of the posture.  
 
Free from grasping - Then settle the respiration in its natural rhythm.  Settle your awareness, as free as possible from graspingâto sensory perceptions, thoughts, memories, images, grasping onto âthis is me, mineâ.  Relax deeply from the core and rest your awareness without grasping to the best of your ability.
 
To what do I aspire - In this stillness pose a simple questionâto what do I aspire?  What is my heartâs desire? Bring to mind your most cherished wishes, your highest aspirations.  How do you envision your own fulfillment?  We so often so busy we lose sight of the big picture. We so easily forget to ask what is the point of all our efforts. Giving now a little space to do that. What is the point of your being here?  For what do you aspire?  With each out breath, embrace this yearning.  
 
 
White light - You may if you wish imagine the light from your heart suffusing your whole being.  And a sort of affection or kindness for yourselfââwith this yearning may I find the happiness and fulfillment that I seek.â  Imagine that this is not beyond your grasp, not beyond your potential.
 
There are all kinds of things that we might want from the world â recognition, money, reputation, affection, acknowledgement â all kinds of things we wish for.  But in order to realize your own deepest aspirations, your own lasting happiness and well being, what do you truly need from the world?  What suffices? Our hearts desire is certainly not something we can do on our own. What would you love to receive from the world in order to realize your own most meaningful aspirations?  
 
 
Reality coming up to meet your aspiration - Then imagine something extraordinaryâthat insofar as our aspirations are deeply rooted in reality, that reality really can rise up to meet us, to provide us all that we truly need to realize our potential.  It as an extraordinary possibility that can shift our whole way of attending to reality altogether.  
 
If it helps you might imagine with each in breath reality rising up to meet you, offering from day to day, moment to moment all that is needed to follow the path to your own fulfillment.  Imagine light coming in from all sides, nurturing, sustaining, supporting you.
 
How would you love to transform - Moment to moment every one of us is changing, we canât help it.  We are always in flux, from moment to moment, day to day, year to year.  We are transforming in order to realize the fulfillment that we seek.  How would you love to transform?  As the potter who is shaping the pot of your own life, how would you love to craft your life, your way of behaving, the quality of your mind?  And what would you love to make you free, with what qualities would you love to be endowed?  
 
Light flowing out - With each out breath imagine if you will the light flowing from your heart and imagine realizing the type of transformation, growth, spiritual maturation that you yourself would love to experience. Let your imagination play.  With each out breath as you arouse this heart of Loving Kindness, reminding yourselfâmay I cultivate the causes of genuine happiness.  
 
Offering to the World - For the sake of your own fulfillment, your own aspiration for meaning in your life, consider now and raise the question what would you love to offer to the world?  It is more than for the benefit for others, thatâs rather unpredictable, what would you love to offer?  And as you look back upon your life, including at the end of the life, you can look back without regret and with a sense of satisfaction that this life was one that was well led.  And with each out breath breathe out this light from your heart and simply imagine offering your very best to those close to you, to your immediate environment and indirectly or directly to the world at large, offer this light of Loving Kindness to others.
 
Finishing - And for a moment release all imaginings and rest in your awareness.  Letâs bring this session to a close.
 




Closing remarks
When we ask this kind of question of ourselves periodically and develop the genuine wish for the best for ourselves, this forms a solid ground of love and care from which compassion can take root. This is the place to start. And the answers this kind of question can gradually evolve as our own understanding, and one could say spiritual maturity also evolves.  So, this is the big picture.

## Full Body Awareness
** Description:**
A guided mindfulness meditation focusing on breath awareness, relaxation, and releasing thoughts through conscious attention and gentle recollection.

### Text
Intro with Full Body awareness

With relaxation as the foundation the very first taste when you enter the practice can be one of sweetness, of ease, of an inviting welcome to the practice. As you let your awareness settle in the body, you immediately feel your shoulders relax, your whole face soft. Let your body be still and rest in a posture of vigilance.

Breath

And get your mind out of the way when it comes to your respiration. Let it flow without intervention, as you deeply relax all the way to the end of the out-breath, until the in-breath, whether it is deep or shallow, short or long, flows in of its own accord. Just let it be.

Let go of thinking come to abdomen

Then disuse the turbulent mind, the mind that is habitually caught up in obsessive thinking and compulsive grasping onto the thinking. Our own obsessive compulsive disorder. Let your awareness come to a rest in this field of sensations with the rise and fall of the abdomen with each in- and out-breath. Attend with your mental awareness, keeping your eyes relaxed, soft, unfocused and certainly not focused downwards. The forehead spacious, open, relaxed. And recall that the first sign of progress in this practice is recognizing how turbulent the mind is, not something to be upset at, simply to acknowledge. And rather than trying to forcefully restraint this, gently release this with every out-breath.

What is mindfulness?

The Buddhist meaning of the term mindfulness is just the opposite of forgetfulness. It has to do with recollection. And in this practice it is the ongoing flow of recollecting, recollecting, recollecting the mind that so easily becomes dispersed. Mindfulness is the opposite of mental entropy.

Releasing and awakening

With each out-breath sustain this ongoing flow of mindfulness while you release the thoughts and grasping onto thoughts. And with each inhalation, recollect your attention. Focus it once again on the sensations of the breath at the abdomen. Just focusing on the sensations themselves with as little conceptual overlay as possible, your best approximation of bare attention.

Counting

If you find counting the breath as a helpful reminder, an enhancer of recollection or mindfulness, then go ahead and count the breaths, one brief count at the end of the each inhalation. Counting 1 through 10 or simply continue counting if you wish, but only if you find it helpful.

Introspection

With your faculty of introspection, note if at any time you fall into dullness and if so, arouse your attention, take a fresh interest. Time and again, you're bound to fall into distraction, being carried away by thoughts. As soon as you note this, let the first response be one of relaxation, releasing the thought, releasing your grasping onto the through. In the same motion, let your awareness descend back to the tactile sensations of the abdomen.

Noting quality of breaths

Noting the duration of each in- and out-breath, and with a gentle exertion of your will, to the best of your ability, let the sensations of the in- and out-breath, the whole course of the cycle of respiration be blanketed continuously with mindfulness.

Let's continue practicing in silence. And let's bring the session to a close.

## NgÃ¶ndro Zuflucht

DORDSCHE TSCHANG THUNGMA - Ich bete zu dem groÃen Dordsche Tschang, Tilo, Naro, Marpa, Mila, Dharmameister Gampopa, DÃ¼sum Khyenpa, dem allwissenden Karmapa, den Haltern der vier groÃen und acht kleinen Linien, Dri, Tag, TsÃ¤l und den glorreichen Drugpa, den unvergleichlichen SchÃ¼tzern der Wesen, den Dagpo-KagyÃ¼pas, die den tiefgrÃ¼ndigen Pfad von Mahamudra gemeistert haben. Gebt euren Segen, dass ich durch euer inspirierendes Beispiel die Linie der KagyÃ¼-Lamas halte.
Es wird gesagt, Abkehr von Samsara ist der FuÃ der Meditation. So gib dem Meditierenden, der frei von Anhaftung an Nahrung und Besitz die Fesseln an dieses Leben zerschneidet, den Segen, dass er ohne Anhaftung an Reichtum und Ehre ist.
Es wird gesagt, Hingabe ist der Kopf der Meditation. Bitte gib dem Meditierenden, der stÃ¤ndig zum Lama betet, der ihm das Tor zur Schatzkammer der mÃ¼ndlichen Belehrungen Ã¶ffnet, deinen Segen, dass in ihm natÃ¼rliche Hingabe entsteht.
Es wird gesagt, Unzerstreutheit ist die eigentliche Meditation (der KÃ¶rper der Meditation). Die Essenz der Gedanken, die entstehen, ist immer neu. Bitte gib deinen Segen, dass der Meditierende, der natÃ¼rlich darin verweilt, beim Meditieren frei von Intellektualisieren ist.
Es wird gesagt, die Essenz der Gedanken ist der Wahrheitszustand. Sie sind nichts und doch entstehen sie. Bitte gib dem Meditierenden, in dem sie als ungehindertes Spiel entstehen, deinen Segen, dass er Samsara und Nirvana als untrennbar erkennt.
In allen Lebenszeiten nicht vom Lama getrennt zu sein und sich des Glanzes seiner Lehren zu erfreuen, die Eigenschaften der Ebenen und Wege vollstÃ¤ndig zu vervollkommnen, mÃ¶ge dadurch der Zustand von Dordsche Tschang schnell erreicht werden.
DIE VIER GRUNDLEGENDEN GEDANKEN - Meditiere zuerst Ã¼ber das kostbare Menschendasein, welches schwer zu erlangen und so leicht zu verlieren ist. Jetzt sollte ich dem Leben Sinn verleihen.
Zweitens sind die Welt und die in ihr lebenden Lebewesen allesamt unbestÃ¤ndig. Besonders das Leben der Wesen ist zerbrechlich wie eine Wasserblase. Der Zeitpunkt unseres Todes ist ungewiss und wir werden dann zu einer Leiche. Weil der Dharma dann von Nutzen ist, sollte ich fleiÃig praktizieren.
Drittens werden wir ohne eigene Kontrolle dem Tod begegnen. Um Karma selbst zu bestimmen, gebe ich alles Unheilsame auf und Ã¼be mich immerzu in guten Taten. So denkend untersuche ich tÃ¤glich meinen eigenen Geist.
Viertens, weil die StÃ¤tten Samsaras, die Freunde, VergnÃ¼gungen, ReichtÃ¼mer und so weiter, mit den drei Arten von Leiden behaftet sind, sind sie wie ein Festmahl, bevor man zur Hinrichtung gefÃ¼hrt wird. Die Anhaftung durchschneidend werde ich unablÃ¤ssig nach der Verwirklichung der Buddhaschaft streben.
ZUFLUCHT UND BODHICHITTA - Vor mir im Himmel ist Guru Vajradhara, umgeben von den Gurus der Linie von Bedeutung und Segen und allen Gurus, denen ich vertraue und zu denen ich eine karmische Verbindung habe. Vor ihnen sind die Yidams, zu ihrer Rechten die Buddhas, dahinter der heilige Dharma, zu ihrer Linken der Sangha. Wie von einem Ozean sind sie jeweils umgeben von einem Gefolge ihresgleichen. 
Mit allen fÃ¼hlenden Wesen, meinen MÃ¼ttern, stehe ich vor den Augen all derer, die die Quellen der Zuflucht sind. Einsgerichtet nehmen wir Zuflucht und erwecken Bodhichitta in uns. Ich und alle fÃ¼hlenden Wesen nehmen Zuflucht zu den Gurus. Wir nehmen Zuflucht zu den Yidams. Wir nehmen Zuflucht zu den Buddhas. Wir nehmen Zuflucht zum Dharma. Wir nehmen Zuflucht zur Sangha.
Pausiere nun die Wiedergabe. Nimm so oft wie mÃ¶glich Zuflucht zu den fÃ¼nf Juwelen. Erhalte dieselbe Visualisation aufrecht und erwecke Bodhichitta.
Bis ich die Essenz der Erleuchtung erlangt habe, nehme ich Zuflucht zu den Buddhas. Auch zum Dharma und zur Versammlung der Bodhisattvas nehme ich Zuflucht.
So wie in der Vergangenheit die Erleuchteten den Bodhichitta-Geist in sich erweckten, so wie sie Schritt fÃ¼r Schritt der Schulung eines Bodhisattvas folgten, So werde auch ich, um den wandernden Wesen zu helfen, den Geist des Bodhichitta erwecken, so werde auch ich, Schritt fÃ¼r Schritt, der Schulung eines Bodhisattvas folgen.
MÃ¶ge das kostbare und hÃ¶chste Bodhichitta dort entstehen, wo es noch nicht entstanden ist. MÃ¶ge es nicht abnehmen, wo es entstanden ist. MÃ¶ge es mehr und mehr zunehmen.
Am Ende lÃ¶sen sich die Zufluchtsobjekte in Licht auf und verschmelzen mit mir.
Kurze Widmung - Ich verteile diesen Verdienst, so dass alle Wesen den Zustand der Buddhaschaft erlangen, indem sie durch die Verbindung von Methode und Weisheit auf dem inneren Weg zum Vajra, dem bestÃ¤ndigen und unsterblichen GlÃ¼ck des Vajra-Geistes gehen. MÃ¶ge ich, nachdem ich durch diesen Verdienst schnell Mahamudra verwirklicht habe, alle Wesen ohne Ausnahme auf diese Stufe bringen.


## Achtsamkeit auf den Atem (StabilitÃ¤t)
**Description**
Meditation aus dem Kurs "Cultivating Emotional Balance" auf: https://anwi.gmbh/?page_id=493&lang=de

**Mediation**
Motivation: - Nachdem du eine bequeme Haltung eingenommen hast, nimm dir einen Moment Zeit um Ã¼ber die Vorteile fÃ¼r dein eigenes Leben nachzudenken, die entstehen, wenn du einen Geist kultivierst, der frei von Unruhe und erfÃ¼llt mit Konzentration und StabilitÃ¤t ist. Konzentriere dich auf jede der QualitÃ¤ten, die du entwickeln mÃ¶chtest, um ein besserer Mensch zu werden.
Den KÃ¶rper in seinen natÃ¼rlichen Zustand versetzen: - Bevor du in die formelle Praxis eintrittst, lÃ¤chle innerlich zu dir selbst und erwecke eine PrÃ¤senz von Leichtigkeit. Nun lasst uns, mit weniger Worten, den KÃ¶rper in seinen natÃ¼rlichen Zustand versetzen, erfÃ¼llt mit den drei QualitÃ¤ten: Entspannung, Stille und Wachsamkeit.
Die Atmung in ihren natÃ¼rlichen Rhythmus versetzen: - Nachdem du den KÃ¶rper in seinen natÃ¼rlichen Zustand gebracht hast, versetze deine Atmung in ihren natÃ¼rlichen Rhythmus. Vertraue darauf, dass dein KÃ¶rper so viel atmet, wie er es braucht, nicht mehr und nicht weniger.
Das Bewusstsein in seinen natÃ¼rlichen Zustand versetzen: - WÃ¤hrend der Atem von alleine ein- und ausflieÃt, lass dein Bewusstsein im gegenwÃ¤rtigen Moment zur Ruhe kommen. Lasse fÃ¼r einen kurzen Augenblick dein Bewusstsein in sich selbst ruhen, lenke deine  Aufmerksamkeit nicht auf irgendetwas, sondern sei einfach bewusst.
Achtsame Atembeobachtung im ganzen KÃ¶rper: - Mit einem GefÃ¼hl der Leichtigkeit, wende dich den Empfindungen im ganzen KÃ¶rper zu insbesondere den Empfindungen die mit dem Atmen verbunden sind. Konzentriere dich darauf, bei jedem Ausatmen die Ã¼berschÃ¼ssige Spannung in KÃ¶rper und Geist loszulassen. Lass dein Bewusstsein sich ausdehnen bis es das gesamte Feld der taktilen Empfindungen umfasst.
Bauch: - Ohne dich zu verspannen, versuche die sanfte Ãbung der Konzentration anzuwenden, indem du deine Aufmerksamkeit auf den Empfindungen des Atems in deinem Bauch ruhen lÃ¤sst. Achte auf das Ansteigen und Abfallen des Bauches bei jeder Ein- und Ausatmung. Halte deine Bauchmuskeln weich und entspannt und verÃ¤ndere den Atem in keiner Weise. Wenn du die Atemempfindungen nicht wahrnehmen kannst, dann achte auf alle anderen Empfindungen im Bauch.
ErhÃ¶he mit jeder Einatmung deine Aufmerksamkeit  und konzentriere dich noch mehr auf den Bauch. Beobachte die Empfindungen im Bauch mit so wenigen Konzepten wie mÃ¶glich und nÃ¤here dich dem nackten Bewusstsein an. 
Entspanne dich mit jedem Ausatmen noch tiefer und lasse sÃ¤mtlichen Druck los, ruhe in einer PrÃ¤senz von Leichtigkeit. Wenn deine Aufmerksamkeit von deinem Bauch weggezogen wird, lass, was immer dich weggezogen hat, los und komme ruhig zurÃ¼ck.
Wecke mit jedem Einatmen deine Aufmerksamkeit und Ã¼berwinde dadurch Laxheit und entspanne dich noch tiefer bei jeder Ausatmung und Ã¼berwinde Erregung. Erlaube auf diese Weise jedem Atemzyklus eine komplette Mediation fÃ¼r sich selbst zu sein, und balanciere so die Aufmerksamkeit aus. Die Achtsamkeit hat hier eine QualitÃ¤t von scharfer Unterscheidung. Bemerke mit jedem Ein- und Ausatmen ob der Atem kurz oder lang ist und erhalte eine QualitÃ¤t von wissen aufrecht.
Achtsamkeit: - In jeder Ãbung zum Trainieren von Aufmerksamkeit, ist es wichtig, ein klares VerstÃ¤ndnis davon zu haben, was das Objekt der Achtsamkeit ist. In dieser Phase der Achtsamkeit auf die Atmung sind es die taktilen Empfindungen des Atmens im Unterleib. Das soll nicht heiÃen, dass nichts anderes im Geist erscheint, aber wir konzentrieren unsere Aufmerksamkeit nicht absichtlich auf etwas anderes. Also, wann immer deine Aufmerksamkeit woanders hinzieht, lasse das, was dich weggefÃ¼hrt hat, los und komm zurÃ¼ck zur Beobachtung des Atmens im Bauch.
Introspektion: - ZusÃ¤tzlich zu deiner anhaltenden Achtsamkeit auf die Empfindung im Bauch, benutze auch die Introspektion und warne dich selbst, wenn Laxheit oder Erregung auftauchen. Sobald du feststellst, dass du stumpf, matt oder lethargisch wirst, ist es an der Zeit, deine Aufmerksamkeit neu zu wecken und ein grÃ¶Ãeres Interesse an der Ãbung zu zeigen.
Wenn du zu irgendeinem Zeitpunkt fest wirst oder Verspannung fÃ¼hlst oder in Gedanken gefangen bist, dann verfolge keinen mÃ¼hseligen Ansatz der UnterdrÃ¼ckung und hÃ¤rterer Anstrengung, sondern werde lockerer und lÃ¶se dich und kehre mit einer PrÃ¤senz der Leichtigkeit und einem freundlichen LÃ¤cheln zurÃ¼ck zur achtsamen Atembeobachtung im Bauch.
Lasst uns jetzt in Stille bis zum Ende weiter Ã¼ben.

Classic Wish-Outcome-Obstacle-Plan Contemplation from https://woopmylife.org/

**Meditation:**
Wish: - Think about the next four weeks or your own timeframe, what is your one dearest wish that you would like to fulfil and that you also think you could fulfil during this time frame? Fulfilling your wish should be challenging for you, but you should feel that it is possible for you. If you have several wishes, select the one that is most important to you. The wish can be about your relationships, your health, a job, school, or anything else that is important to you. Find this one specific wish, summarize it in 3 to 6 words, and keep it in the front of your mind.
Outcome: - Now, what is the best thing, the best outcome that you associate with fulfilling your wish? How would fulfilling your wish make you feel? What would be the best thing about achieving your wish? Find the best outcome, summarize it in 3 to 6 words, and keep it in the front of your mind.
Now, imagine this best outcome as vividly as possible. Give your thoughts and images free reign. Let your mind go. You can close your eyes if you would like. Imagine and feel it as fully as you can.
Obstacle: - What holds you back from realizing your wish? What is it in you that stands in the way of you making your wish come true? What is the obstacle in you that stands in the way of you fulfilling your wish? What behavior of yours or what emotion could hinder you from fulfilling your wish? Dig deeper, what is in you that stops you from realizing your wish? What is your one main inner obstacle? Find it, summarize it in 3 to 6 words, and keep it in the front of your mind.
And again, imagine your one main inner obstacle occurring as vividly as possible. Give your thoughts and images free reign. Let your mind go. You can close your eyes if you would like. Imagine this one main obstacle. Imagine and feel it as fully as you can.
Plan: - What can you do to overcome your obstacle? Identify one action you can take or one thought you can think to overcome your obstacle. What can you do? Identify one action or one thought. Find it, summarize it in 3 to 6 words, and keep it in the front of your mind.
Now make an if-then plan: Take your obstacle and place it after the word âif.â Similarly, place the behavior to overcome your obstacle after the word âthenâ: If my obstacle appears then I will take this action or thought to overcome my obstacle. Once more: If my obstacle appears then I will take this action or thought to overcome my obstacle.


## Metta-Sutta
**Description**
Das Sutra von der liebenden GÃ¼te (Ã¼bersetzt von Vimalo)

**Meditation:**
Wem klar geworden, dass der Frieden des Geistes das Ziel seines Lebens ist, der bemÃ¼he sich um folgende Gesinnung: Er sei stark, aufrecht und gewissenhaft freundlich, sanft und ohne Stolz.
GenÃ¼gsam sei er leicht befriedigt nicht viel geschÃ¤ftig und bedÃ¼rfnislos. Die Sinne still,  klar der Verstand, nicht dreist nicht gierig sei sein Verhalten.
Auch nicht im Kleinsten soll er sich vergehen wofÃ¼r ihn VerstÃ¤ndige tadeln kÃ¶nnten. MÃ¶gen alle Wesen glÃ¼cklich sein und Frieden finden.
Was es auch an lebenden Wesen gibt: ob stark oder schwach, ob groÃ oder klein, ob sichtbar oder unsichtbar, fern oder nah, ob geboren oder einer Geburt zustrebend, - mÃ¶gen sie alle glÃ¼cklich sein.
Niemand betrÃ¼ge oder verachte einen anderen. Aus Ãrger oder Ãbelwollen wÃ¼nsche man keinem irgendwelches UnglÃ¼ck.
Wie eine Mutter mit ihrem Leben ihr einzig Kind beschÃ¼tzt und behÃ¼tet, so mÃ¶ge man fÃ¼r alle Wesen und die ganze Welt ein unbegrenzt gÃ¼tiges GemÃ¼t erwecken: ohne Hass, ohne Feindschaft, ohne BeschrÃ¤nkung nach oben, nach unten und nach allen Seiten.
Im Gehen oder Stehen, im Sitzen oder Liegen entfalte man eifrig diese Gesinnung: Dies nennt man Weilen im Heiligen.
Wer sich nicht an Ansichten verliert, Tugend und Einsicht gewinnt, dem Sinnengenuss nicht verhaftet ist â fÃ¼r den gibt es keine Geburt mehr.
