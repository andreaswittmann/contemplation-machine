**Title:** 
MAHAMUDRA ASPIRATION by Karmapa Rangjung Dorje

**Description:**
NAMO GURU

**Instructions:**
1. Gurus, yidams, and deities of the mandala, Victorious ones of the three times and ten directions, together with your descendants, Please consider us with compassion and grant your blessings So that our aspirations may be accomplished just as we intend.
2. May the river of the accumulated virtue of threefold purity, Springing from the snow mountain of the pure thoughts and deeds Of ourselves and limitless sentient beings Flow into the ocean of the four kayas of the victorious ones.
3. Until this is accomplished, Through all our lives, birth after birth, May we not even hear the words "evil deeds" and "suffering," And enjoy the glorious ocean of happiness and virtue.
4. Being free and well-favored, endowed with faith, exertion, and pranja, Relying on an excellent spiritual friend, and receiving the pith instructions, May we encounter no obstacles to practicing them correctly, And may we practice the holy dharma through all our lives.
5. Studying scriptures and reasoning frees from the obscuration of ignorance. Contemplating the oral instructions conquers the darkness of doubt. The light born of meditation illuminates the natural state, just as it is. May the brilliance of the three pranjas increase.
6. Through the ground of the two truths, free from the extremes of eternalism and nihilism, And through the supreme path of the two accumulations, free from the extremes of exaggeration and denial, May we attain the fruition of the two benefits, free from the extremes of samsara and nirvana, And so meet with the unerring dharma.
7. The basis of purification is mind itself, the unity of luminosity and emptiness. The means of purification is the great vajra yoga of mahamudra What is to be purified is the temporary stains of confusion. May we manifest the result of purification, the stainless dharmakaya.
8. Cutting doubts about the ground is confidence in the view. Sustaining that without wandering is the key point of meditation. Training in all aspects of meditation is supreme action. May we have confidence in the view, meditation, and action.
9. All phenomena are the illusory display of mind. There is no mind; mind is empty of an essence. Empty and unceasing, it appears as anything whatsoever. Investigating this thoroughly, may we ascertain the ground.
10. Our nonexistent projections are mistaken to be objects. Through ignorance, intrinsic awareness is mistaken to be a self. Through clinging to this duality, we wander within samsara. May we cut the root of ignorance and confusion.
11. It is not existent, as even the victorious ones have not seen it. It is not nonexistent, as it is the basis of all, samsara and nirvana. This is not a contradiction, as it is the middle way of unity. May we realize the dharmata of mind, free from extremes.
12. It cannot be shown by saying, "This is it." It cannot be refuted by saying, "This is not it." It is unconditioned dharmata, beyond conceptual mind. May we know with certainty the perfect ultimate truth.
13. Whoever does not realize this circles in the ocean of samsara; Whoever realizes this is no other than a buddha. Everything is altogether free from "it is this" or "it is not this." May we know the secret nature of dharmata, the ground of all.
14. Appearance is mind; emptiness is also mind. Realization is mind; confusion is also mind. Birth is mind; cessation is also mind. May we cut through all doubts about mind.
15. Unspoiled by deliberate, conceptual meditation, Unmoved by the wind of ordinary busyness, May we skillfully sustain the essential practice of mind That knows how to rest naturally in the uncontrived, innate state.
16. The waves of coarse and subtle thoughts subsiding by themselves, May the water of unmoving mind rest naturally. Free from the disturbances of drowsiness and dullness, May the ocean of shamatha be stable and unmoving.
17. Looking again and again at the mind that cannot be looked at, What cannot be seen is seen clearly, just as it is. Cutting doubts about what it is or is not, Free from confusion, may our true nature recognize itself.
18. Looking at objects, there are no objects; we see only mind. Looking at mind, there is no mind; it is empty of an essence. Looking at both, dualistic clinging is spontaneously liberated. May we realize luminosity, the true nature of mind.
19. Free from mental fabrications, it is mahamudra Free from extremes, it is the great madhyamaka. Containing everything, it is also known as the great completion. May we gain confidence that, by knowing just this, we realize the meaning of all.
20. Great bliss, free from attachment, is unceasing. Luminosity, free from clinging to concepts, is unobscured. Nonthought, beyond intellect, is spontaneously present. May these experiences, free from effort, be unceasing.
21. Clinging to good experiences is spontaneously liberated. The confusion of negative thoughts is naturally purified in space. Ordinary mind, free from accepting and rejecting, loss and gain. May we realize the truth of dharmat, simplicity.
22. Though the nature of beings is always enlightened, Not realizing this, they wander endlessly in samsara. May overwhelming compassion be born in us For sentient beings whose suffering is boundless.
23. In the moment of love, when overwhelming compassion flows freely, Its empty nature nakedly appears. May we meditate day and night Inseparable from this unity, the supreme unerring path.
24. Through the dharma eyes and higher perceptions born of meditation, May we ripen sentient beings, establish buddha fields, And fulfill our aspiration to attain the qualities of a buddha. Having perfected ripening, establishing, and fulfilling, may we attain buddhahood.
25. By the power of the compassion of the victorious ones of the ten directions and their descendants And by the power of all the pure virtue there is, May our pure aspirations and those of all sentient beings Be accomplished just as we intend.

 ## MettaâLoving Kindness
 
 
 
Relaxing a Small Child - We train the mind as if we were bringing up a very small child.  In the earliest phases utterly gentle.  As you settle your body in its natural state, first of all with the sole emphasis just on relaxation, utterly gentle and loose.  Then as with a very young child you introduce a mild degree of discipline, the stillness of the body and   then finally you introduce the element of vigilance.  This fine balance, the gentleness persists but balance with the stillness and the vigilance of the posture.  
 
Free from grasping - Then settle the respiration in its natural rhythm.  Settle your awareness, as free as possible from graspingâto sensory perceptions, thoughts, memories, images, grasping onto âthis is me, mineâ.  Relax deeply from the core and rest your awareness without grasping to the best of your ability.
 
To what do I aspire - In this stillness pose a simple questionâto what do I aspire?  What is my heartâs desire? Bring to mind your most cherished wishes, your highest aspirations.  How do you envision your own fulfillment?  We so often so busy we lose sight of the big picture. We so easily forget to ask what is the point of all our efforts. Giving now a little space to do that. What is the point of your being here?  For what do you aspire?  With each out breath, embrace this yearning.  
 
 
White light - You may if you wish imagine the light from your heart suffusing your whole being.  And a sort of affection or kindness for yourselfââwith this yearning may I find the happiness and fulfillment that I seek.â  Imagine that this is not beyond your grasp, not beyond your potential.
 
There are all kinds of things that we might want from the world â recognition, money, reputation, affection, acknowledgement â all kinds of things we wish for.  But in order to realize your own deepest aspirations, your own lasting happiness and well being, what do you truly need from the world?  What suffices? Our hearts desire is certainly not something we can do on our own. What would you love to receive from the world in order to realize your own most meaningful aspirations?  
 
 
Reality coming up to meet your aspiration - Then imagine something extraordinaryâthat insofar as our aspirations are deeply rooted in reality, that reality really can rise up to meet us, to provide us all that we truly need to realize our potential.  It as an extraordinary possibility that can shift our whole way of attending to reality altogether.  
 
If it helps you might imagine with each in breath reality rising up to meet you, offering from day to day, moment to moment all that is needed to follow the path to your own fulfillment.  Imagine light coming in from all sides, nurturing, sustaining, supporting you.
 
How would you love to transform - Moment to moment every one of us is changing, we canât help it.  We are always in flux, from moment to moment, day to day, year to year.  We are transforming in order to realize the fulfillment that we seek.  How would you love to transform?  As the potter who is shaping the pot of your own life, how would you love to craft your life, your way of behaving, the quality of your mind?  And what would you love to make you free, with what qualities would you love to be endowed?  
 
Light flowing out - With each out breath imagine if you will the light flowing from your heart and imagine realizing the type of transformation, growth, spiritual maturation that you yourself would love to experience. Let your imagination play.  With each out breath as you arouse this heart of Loving Kindness, reminding yourselfâmay I cultivate the causes of genuine happiness.  
 
Offering to the World - For the sake of your own fulfillment, your own aspiration for meaning in your life, consider now and raise the question what would you love to offer to the world?  It is more than for the benefit for others, thatâs rather unpredictable, what would you love to offer?  And as you look back upon your life, including at the end of the life, you can look back without regret and with a sense of satisfaction that this life was one that was well led.  And with each out breath breathe out this light from your heart and simply imagine offering your very best to those close to you, to your immediate environment and indirectly or directly to the world at large, offer this light of Loving Kindness to others.
 
Finishing - And for a moment release all imaginings and rest in your awareness.  Letâs bring this session to a close.
 




Closing remarks
When we ask this kind of question of ourselves periodically and develop the genuine wish for the best for ourselves, this forms a solid ground of love and care from which compassion can take root. This is the place to start. And the answers this kind of question can gradually evolve as our own understanding, and one could say spiritual maturity also evolves.  So, this is the big picture.

Intro with Full Body awareness

With relaxation as the foundation the very first taste when you enter the practice can be one of sweetness, of ease, of an inviting welcome to the practice. As you let your awareness settle in the body, you immediately feel your shoulders relax, your whole face soft. Let your body be still and rest in a posture of vigilance.

Breath

And get your mind out of the way when it comes to your respiration. Let it flow without intervention, as you deeply relax all the way to the end of the out-breath, until the in-breath, whether it is deep or shallow, short or long, flows in of its own accord. Just let it be.

Let go of thinking come to abdomen

Then disuse the turbulent mind, the mind that is habitually caught up in obsessive thinking and compulsive grasping onto the thinking. Our own obsessive compulsive disorder. Let your awareness come to a rest in this field of sensations with the rise and fall of the abdomen with each in- and out-breath. Attend with your mental awareness, keeping your eyes relaxed, soft, unfocused and certainly not focused downwards. The forehead spacious, open, relaxed. And recall that the first sign of progress in this practice is recognizing how turbulent the mind is, not something to be upset at, simply to acknowledge. And rather than trying to forcefully restraint this, gently release this with every out-breath.

What is mindfulness?

The Buddhist meaning of the term mindfulness is just the opposite of forgetfulness. It has to do with recollection. And in this practice it is the ongoing flow of recollecting, recollecting, recollecting the mind that so easily becomes dispersed. Mindfulness is the opposite of mental entropy.

Releasing and awakening

With each out-breath sustain this ongoing flow of mindfulness while you release the thoughts and grasping onto thoughts. And with each inhalation, recollect your attention. Focus it once again on the sensations of the breath at the abdomen. Just focusing on the sensations themselves with as little conceptual overlay as possible, your best approximation of bare attention.

Counting

If you find counting the breath as a helpful reminder, an enhancer of recollection or mindfulness, then go ahead and count the breaths, one brief count at the end of the each inhalation. Counting 1 through 10 or simply continue counting if you wish, but only if you find it helpful.

Introspection

With your faculty of introspection, note if at any time you fall into dullness and if so, arouse your attention, take a fresh interest. Time and again, you're bound to fall into distraction, being carried away by thoughts. As soon as you note this, let the first response be one of relaxation, releasing the thought, releasing your grasping onto the through. In the same motion, let your awareness descend back to the tactile sensations of the abdomen.

Noting quality of breaths

Noting the duration of each in- and out-breath, and with a gentle exertion of your will, to the best of your ability, let the sensations of the in- and out-breath, the whole course of the cycle of respiration be blanketed continuously with mindfulness.

Let's continue practicing in silence. And let's bring the session to a close.
